# Roulette-Pair_Programming


An attempt to create Roulette the game. Lets get a pair programming project going see if it will workout on this repo

# Roulette
The Game of Roulette
Needs Functionality!!

Drag n' drop prototype chips bugs
--- Only works as a async script

-- Placing drag n drop in functions only works when you click once and click a 2nd time and hold. 
    -- Need to try with event handlers

-- The value comes up for the chips but not the first time

-- Using drag n drop module  of img id requires one click held down to work. 1 single click without mouse held down causes error of postitinoing and holding it down still. 

--Make prototypes of ways that work
           
        
    Error control & boundries
        -- Make the mouse reset while mouse down and out of browser screen space
        -- Change chip location based on where mouse down and arrow are both at

----------------------------------------------------
Pop over modal for bets
    -- When you click be able to type in a bet and see it left on the bet spot
        
Both Popover modal and drag n drop
    -- Change the background color on hover over with bets

Start the spin
    -- Deduct money from the bet amounts
        -- Animate each Number as it turns with background and color changes
